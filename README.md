# wlibrary

Hi there! My name is Wenddell. This is a library that I created for creating nav-bars quickly and easily. I will add more functionality later, but for now, this is what I've got.

To create a navbar, create a div element and give it the class of nav-bar. For each item in the navbar, create an anchor tag with the class nav-bar-item. If you wnat a larger link, you can put it in the top of your div. It should be and anchor tag with the class homepage-link. 

To get this to work, you must include this link in the head section of your document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://true-2-wild.github.io/wlibrary/css/styles.css">
```

If you want to use the fonts that I do, you can paste this too.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Alata&family=Quicksand&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">  </head>
```

Enjoy!
